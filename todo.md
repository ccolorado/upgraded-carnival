Task: Develop a Simple Weighted Index Smart Contract

Create a basic Ethereum smart contract that represents a weighted index of 2 cryptocurrencies. The contract should include the following functionality:

1. Initialize the index with two tokens and their respective weights.
2. Implement a function to calculate the current index value based on token prices.
3. Create a simple rebalancing function to adjust token weights.

Requirements:
- Use Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.
- Implement the contract as an ERC20 token.
- Use mock price feeds for token prices (can be hardcoded or updatable).
- Include basic error handling and input validation.
- Add comments explaining your code.

Bonus (optional):
- Implement a function to mint/burn index tokens.
- Add events to log important actions (e.g., rebalancing).

Time limit: 72 hour

Evaluation criteria:
- Code quality and organization
- Correct implementation of weighted index logic
- Understanding of Solidity and smart contract concepts
- Ability to handle basic financial calculations
